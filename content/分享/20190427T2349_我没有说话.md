> In Germany they came first for the Communists,  
and I didn't speak up  
because I wasn't a Communist.

> Then they came for the Jews,  
and I didn't speak up  
because I wasn't a Jew.

> Then they came for the trade unionists,  
and I didn't speak up  
because I wasn't a trade unionist.

> Then they came for the Catholics,  
and I didn't speak up  
because I was a Protestant.

> Then they came for me,  
and by that time no one was left  
to speak up for me.

> ― Martin Niemöller
